Last year was fun and so fast. I never seen my life that time feels so fast. I believe it's because getting old make our brain perceived memory through time 100x more forgetfull than our childhood. Anyway, the new icon made by profesional designer friend of mine from University. The white cat and the black background really awesome and super cute. I hope this new icon make me realize how important is everything even small things. When someone told me, what I hope for this new year in 2024, that is I hope this new year would make a fast decision for everything and can see small things.
