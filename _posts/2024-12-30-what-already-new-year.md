## It Feels Like a month ago

This year I have learn so much, from DOTS, OOD, Steam, UI Toolkit. Now that I mention UI Toolkit Unity, it was scarry to try implement to my client, however, the client so much happy with the results, despite I don't have UI/UX certification.

I want like UI Toolkit + DOTS that would be awesome, but connecting UI to DOTS, how?? Like UI Toolkit is managed but DOTS unmanaged... Maybe I will try learn more later how to connect both.
