## A new website
So I have made a website that use github pages and Jekyll with theme Chirpy. It's really take time and patience to set up website. I need to install a, b, c and so on. But right now it's working and I think it's cool (thanks to Chirpy theme). Well, the theme it's popular on github, I believe it's also support dark and light mode. Dark mode is now a thing! That's why you will see this website in dark mode. I think it's enough to write this long. This is just some test to build on github pages. I don't know how long this take to build and deploy. Okay time to deploy!
